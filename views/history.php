            <p class="mb-4">
                Origami is the art of paper folding. Its name derives from Japanese words ori (“folding”) and kami
                (“paper”). Traditional origami consists of folding a single sheet of square paper (often with a
                colored
                side) into a sculpture without cutting, gluing, taping, or even marking it.

            <p class="mb-4">
                Writing a comprehensive history of paper folding is almost impossible, since information about the
                art
                form prior to the 15th century is virtually nonexistent. There are many plausible assertions about
                its
                origins and early history, but most of those are based on little firm documentation. Many studies
                assert
                that origami was invented by the Japanese about a thousand years ago, but its roots may well be in
                China. It is also highly probable that the process of folding was applied to other materials before
                paper was invented, so the origins of recreational folding may lie with cloth or leather. Certainly,
                within Europe, the practise of napkin folding and cloth pleating were held in high esteem. However,
                paper has proved to be the ideal material to fold, and so it is logical to assume that paper folding
                followed the discovery of the papermaking process.

                Paper was invented in China around 105 AD, and folded paper—or zhezhi—most likely emerged shortly
                after.
                By 900 AD, paper yuanbao, or gold nuggets, were a staple at traditional Chinese funerals.

                Paper was introduced to Japan in the 6th century. During this time, the practice of paper folding
                emerged as a ceremonial Shinto ritual. It was not until Japan's Edo Period (1603 – 1868) that
                origami
                would also be viewed as a leisurely activity and art form.

                        cut the sheets of paper. Today, however, true origami is sculpted entirely through folds—an
                        attribute the Japanese adopted from Europe.</p>

                the
                17th century. Much like Japanese origami, napkin-folding featured different methods and techniques
                that

                As the founder of kindergartens, Fröbel incorporated several hands-on activities into his “play

                        folded differently to realize a different part of the subject. Composite origami was one of

                        using
                        only
                        square paper and “mountain” and “valley” folds, resulting in models that are easy to

                <li>
                    <p>Tessellations: A geometric folding technique in which the image is created by the pattern of
                        folded
                        edges across the paper. Tessellations are often periodic (repeating) and may be flat or
                        three-dimensional, and many of them exhibit further structure when held up to the light. Not
                        surprisingly, many of the leading practitioners of this technique have been mathematicians.

                <li>
                    <p>Wet folding: A technique invented by Akira Yoshizawa in which the paper contains a
                        water-soluble
                        glue
                        (known as sizing) and is dampened slightly before folding. The dampness permits the paper to
                        be
                        folded
                        into soft curves, which then harden in durability as the paper dries.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>Crumpled: A technique created by Paul Jackson and developed by Vincent Floderer that involves
                        the
                        crumpling of the paper before folding. This technique can produce highly realistic organic

                    <p class="mb-4">Akira Yoshizawa was the father of modern origami. He inspired a national and
                        international interest in the art of origami. Yoshizawa developed the current standard for
                        diagraming origami instructions and designed countless patterns. He avoided the accepted cutting
                        techniques used in traditional origami and developed a wet folding technique which rendered
                        softer more naturalistic lines. Yoshizawa published ”Origami Tokuhon” in 1957 which brought him
                        great renown. He published many more books thereafter and later served as a cultural ambassador
                        for Japan. In 1983 he received the honor of Japan’s Order of the Rising Sun. </p>

                    <p class="mb-4">Kosho Uchiyama was a Buddhist priest and origami master from Japan. He published
                        ”Origami Zukan” a children’s instructional book for origami in 1958. Unlike the standard today,
                        Uchiyama’s book allowed for some cutting. He went on to publish several more books of origami,
                        following in the footsteps of his father Michio Uchiyama who also wrote several origami books.
                        Though Kosho Uchiyama’s folds were not as elegant as Akira Yoshizawa, he was considered
                        contemporary rival of Yoshizawa. Like Uchiyama, his books were translated and shared with
                        international audiences.</p>

                Many contemporary origami artists continue to create works inspired by age-old techniques. Some, like
                Gonzalo Garcia Calvo and Mademoiselle Maurice, do not employ adhesives or cuts in their work, while
                others, like Cristian Marianciuc have creatively reinterpreted the practice through strategic snips.
